<head>

</head>
<body>

**[all the html to display]**
</body>
</html>
Enclose all HTML work within an <html>....</html> tag. 
To create a new HTML document, open a new document in Notepad (Notepad should be located under programs/accessories). You will type all your HTML code into this document. 
To start, type the following HTML code into Notepad.
When you are done typing save your document. When you save an HTML document in Notepad, you must specify that it should be saved as an HTML document. To do this, choose Save As from the file menu. Type in the file name followed by .html.

4)Parent and child element?

For eg:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
<title> web designing Course</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet"type="text/css"href="styles.css"media="screen"> 
    </head>
<body>
<header>
<hgroup>
