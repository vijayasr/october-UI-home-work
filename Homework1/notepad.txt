1) Clone, commit, push

Clone Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned 
repository (visible using git branch -r), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s currently active branch.

As a convenience, cloning automatically creates a remote connection called origin pointing back to the original repository. This makes it very easy to interact with a central repository.
